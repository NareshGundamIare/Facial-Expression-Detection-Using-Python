# Facial-Expression-Detection-Using-Python
This project aims to develop a facial expression detection system using the Python 
programming language and various libraries such as CV2, DeepFace, and Matplotlib. The 
system will utilize computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms to accurately 
detect and classify facial expressions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, and 
fear. The project will involve collecting a dataset of facial images with labelled expressions, 
pre-processing the images, and using the DeepFace library to extract facial features from the 
images. The extracted features will then be fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) 
model built using the cv2library to classify facial expressions. Finally, the Matplotlib library 
will be used to visualize the detected expressions in real-time from a video stream or image 
input. The proposed system has potential applications in various fields, such as humancomputer 
interaction, psychology, and healthcare. The use of DeepFace and CV2 libraries is 
expected to enhance the accuracy and speed of the facial expression detection system.
